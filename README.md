# ML Loan Approval Prediction Modal
####	To predict that a loan application will be accepted or rejected by the Training Model with pre-existing data.
####	We clean data, fill null values, do Statistical analysis, and Split the dataset into Train and test datasets.
####	Then use label Encoder and Standard scaler from Sci-Kit Learn to make data feedable and last use Classifiers like K-neighbors, Decision tree, Navie-Bayes, and Random Forest.
####	In which accuracy of Navie-Bayes is 81.3%.
